## Carousel

The purpose of this homework is to leverage views, view properties, and events to create a high fidelity prototype that is difficult to distinguish from a production app. We're going to use the techniques from this week to implement the Carousel app from the signed out state to the basic signed in state.

#### The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. CGAffine Transforms
2. popNavigation did't work in one place even though my button was recieving taps
